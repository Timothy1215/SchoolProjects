# Database Web Application

This is a web application for demonstrating database queries. We used mock data to run queries on, so if you want to run the application fully, you will need to set up a database with mock data. In our project, we used MySQL.

This project is on my github for viewing the frontend which is what I (Tim) built. I also built a lot of the backend by setting it up and creating the APIs. Darian did most of the core coding in the backend such as creating the queries.

## Installation

Make sure you have Angular installed. If you want to use the backend as well, you will need to set up a database and have Express.

## Running program

Open a terminal and run
```
ng serve
```

Open a browser and go to http://localhost:4200 to see the program
