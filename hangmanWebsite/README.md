## Description
This is a web application for playing Grammarian (Hangman) with saved users. 

This was one of my first ever websites I built with both frontend and backend. It was also my first website using Angular.

## Installation

Make sure you have Angular, Express, and MongoDB (Free small verison) installed.

## Running program

Open 3 terminals and run the following in order:
Anywhere in one of the terminals run:
```
mongod
```

In the next terminal, cd into the server folder and run:
```
npm start
```

In the last terminal, cd into the client folder and run:
```
ng serve
```

Open a browser and go to http://localhost:4200 to see the program
