# CS224 Python Project

## Author(s)

Daniel Gruber, Timothy Thoman, Darian Boeck

## Description

This is a recreation of the classic snake game. Our project is unique because it has a lot of added features to the original game such as different game modes, music, sounds, and visuals.

Most of this program is built by Daniel while most of the music, sounds, and visuals were done by me (Tim) and Darian.

## Installations

Python3 is the only required installation.

## How to use the software

Open a terminal and cd into the same location as the py file and run it with:
```
python3 snake.py
```
